# Online Resume
I saw a [good article](https://css-tricks.com/new-year-new-job-lets-make-a-grid-powered-resume/) from [Ali Churcher](https://css-tricks.com/author/alichurcher/) online and thought it would be cool to run with that since the last time I updated my "Resume" repo was way back in 2016.

I want to revamp this to become:

1. Grid-based
2. Mobile-first
3. Just a better looking site now that I've learned more.
